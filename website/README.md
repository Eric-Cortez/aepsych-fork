## Installation

**Requirements**:
- You need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 8.x and
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) >= 1.5 in order to build the  website.


To Install AEPsych on your local machine please clone the project repository.


```bash
 git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/aepsych.git
```

Switch into to the `website/` directory from within the AEPsych project root and install dependencies before starting the server:
```bash
cd website
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 (if doesn't automatically open).

Anytime you change the contents of the page or manipulate the DOM, the page should auto-update.

## Building

Note: The installation instructions above do not re-build the API reference (auto-generated by
Sphinx) or parse and embed the tutorial notebooks. To rebuild the website with updated content run the following script from the root directory of the AEPsych project.
```bash
./scripts/build_docs.sh
```






<!--
#### Generating a static build

To generate a static build of the website in the `website/build` directory, run
```bash
./scripts/build_docs.sh -b
```

## Publishing

The site is hosted on GitHub pages, via the `gh-pages` branch of the AEPsych
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/aepsych/tree/gh-pages).
The website is automatically built and published from GitHub Actions - see the
[config file]( ) for the nightly build job for details.
